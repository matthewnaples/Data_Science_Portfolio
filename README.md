20 second overview of each project. Use this to navigate through my portfolio. :)


## [Project 1](https://matthewnaples.github.io/Individual_Strength_Analysis/)
* gathered over a year of my own strength training data to help increase my strength on the squat, bench press, and deadlift. 
* I used data to *diagnose* why my programs were/weren't leading to results and to change programs accordingly.
* As a result, I put 30 pounds on my bench press (310-340 lbs) , 50 pounds on my squat (405-455) , and about 65 pounds on my deadlift (430-495)  after nearly a year of stagnating results.
