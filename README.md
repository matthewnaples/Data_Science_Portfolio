## Using individual strength training data to find a training regimen that allows for sufficient progress in the squat, bench press, and deadlift.

* As a result of the analysis, I put 30 pounds on my bench press (310-340 lbs) , 50 pounds on my squat (405-455) , and about 65 pounds on my deadlift (430-495)  after nearly a year of stagnating results.
* Before the analysis, I gathered my resistance training data for approximately one year. 
* I used data to diagnose why my programs were/weren't leading to results. Based on the diagnoses from one strength training program, I updated aspects of the succeeding program. 
* No statistical modeling was used for the following reasons: (1) I'm not estimating population parameters; (2) time series forecast is useless when I am knowingly going to manipulate causal factors that will change said forecast.

## Predicting strength changes in the powerlifting population over time using ARIMA models
#### Read the report [here](https://matthewnaples.github.io/powerlifting_TSA/)
#### View code at the original repo [here](https://github.com/matthewnaples/powerlifting_TSA/) 
* Using arima forecasting, I predict change in the powerlifting population over time with a Mean Absolute Error of ~ 5 IPF-points, which can be interpreted as around 80 pounds (for a 185 pound male).
